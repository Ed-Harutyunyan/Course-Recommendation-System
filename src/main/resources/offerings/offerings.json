In the first part of the course, we will have a journal club-style study of recently published papers. For example, we will study how the protein folding problem has been largely solved using transformer-based deep learning algorithms, and we will learn about novel protein design using diffusion models. In the second part of the course, students will conduct group projects where they will apply ML algorithms to address problems from natural or applied sciences.",

Both refer to practical inferential methods that use probability models for both observable and unobservable quantities. The flexibility and generality of these methods allow them to address complex real-life problems that are not amenable to other techniques. This course will also provide a pragmatic introduction to powerful applications of those methods. Topics include: the basics of Bayesian inference for single and multiparameter models, regression, hierarchical models, model checking, approximation of a posterior distribution by iterative and non-iterative sampling methods.",

Development requires respect for human rights, and respect for human rights prevents conflicts.

While many inventions, from the printing press to the combustion engine to electricity to the atomic bomb have been available to a select few elites, the power of artificial intelligence is now at the fingertips of almost anyone with a connected device, and has sky-rocketed in its impact on everything from education to medicine to creating content to waging war. How can we make sure that we, as future creators and consumers of AI-enabled products and services, have the right tools and context to make sure that what we create, or utilize, does more good than harm? While the topic is vast, we will jointly explore concrete examples from different sectors to help us become more informed participants in this latest technology arms race. The course will consist of a combination of lectures, case study discussions, screening and discussion of movies and TV shows, as well as guest speakers.",

The main role of political parties (at least in democratic regimes) is to bring together like-minded citizens\u2014sometimes with a shared ideology\u2014to achieve electoral success and to govern a country based on their vision.\nThis course will explore the concept of political parties, how they are formed and organized and how they influence and are, in turn, influenced by electoral politics. Through lectures and discussions students will try to answer questions such as: Are parties important for democracies? What role do parties play in linking various societal strata with the state? How do parties shape the party system in their respective countries? How has the role of parties changed, and continues to change, over the centuries and decades?",

    "course_description": "This course explores the various theories that scholars and researchers have put forward concerning second language acquisition, or how people learn languages. Since it is language learning that is being examined, it is important to understand what language is. Linguistics explores this question, and hence, this course draws to some extent on insights from linguistics. In addition, as people and learning have both social and psychological dimensions, the course also draws on insights from sociology and psychology. In other words, SLA is an inter-disciplinary subject that draws on all three disciplines, as well as the sub-disciplines and research areas that inter-relate them. Three hours of instructor-led discussion per week.",
